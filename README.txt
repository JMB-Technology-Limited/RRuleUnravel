RRuleUnravel PHP Composer Library
=================================

Takes an iCal/ics RRULE and returns you all the occurences of that Rule.

It is marked pre version 1 as it does not deal will all parts of the iCal/ics RRULE spec yet, only some parts. It will not be marked v1.0 until it deals will all the commonly used parts.
